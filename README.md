## Chapter 1
- ### Brain Computer Interfaces
Brain-computer communication deals with the creation of communication paths between the brain and external devices. BCI devices can be broadly classified depending on the location of the electrodes used to detect and measure neurons in the brain: In invasive devices, electrodes are placed on the scalp and electroencephalography or electrocorticography is used to detect neuronal activity. This WTEC study is designed to gather information on the global situation and trends in BCI research and disseminate it to government decision-makers and the research community. This study examines the state of sensor technology and evaluates biocompatibility, data analysis and modeling, hardware implementation, device engineering, functional electrical stimulation, functional communication devices, and cognitive and emotional weakness in academic and industry research. The jury identified several key trends in evolving BCI research in North America, Europe, and Asia. First, BCI research is widespread around the world, and its size is clearly increasing. Second, BCI research is rapidly approaching the level of first-generation medical application; In addition, BCI research is expected to accelerate rapidly in the non-medical fields of business, particularly in the gaming, automotive, and robotics industries. Third, the focus of BCI research around the world is completely unequal, as non-invasive BCI devices are concentrated almost exclusively in North America; he does.<br>
In terms of budget, BCIs and brain-controlled robotics programs have been the hallmark of recent European research and technology development.<br>
Although many government programs are being developed by neural networks, private resources still have a major impact on BCI research in North America. However, small research grants and small technology transfer research have been effective in promoting the transition from basic research to prototypes. In Asia, China is investing heavily in life sciences and engineering, and investment in the BCI system and BCI-related research has increased particularly rapidly.<br>
Japanese universities, research institutes and laboratories are also increasing their investment in BCI research.<br>
Japan is particularly strong in pursuing non-medical applications and exploiting its expertise in BCI-controlled robotics.<br>
The jury concluded that there are many opportunities for global collaboration in bci research and related fields.<br>

## Chapter 2
- ### Name of sensor technology
This chapter reviews the sensors used in data collection for Brain-Computer Interface Technology (BCI). For the purposes of this chapter, we divide sensor technologies into two main categories. First, we discuss "invasive" technologies that involve brain surgeries for implantation, including predominantly multielectrode recordings of micro-electrode arrays located in the brain to measure the action potentials of individual cells. This area is the biggest growth for sensor technologies and will be the main focus of this season. However, we warn that most of this technology is being developed in animal models and has not yet been approved for human use. In addition, the measurement of subdural or epidural strips of electrode arrays used to record cortical potential will be somewhat similar to EEG recordings on the surface of the skull, as this is currently the largest application of these invasive electrodes in humans. (Primarily) Epilepsy surgery. However, this can help increase the growth of other BCI programs. Second, we discuss "non-invasive" technologies, which primarily include multielectrode EEG recording arrays of wet silver (silver) or gold (Au) paste electrodes placed on the surface of the skull to record EEG activity. These electrodes are commercially available from a number of sources, but surprisingly, limited growth has been observed in this area. We warn that "non-invasive" electrodes are mainly used and may be used aggressively for the scalp in chronic and more advanced applications of BCI technology by humans at home or at work in the future. The development of additional technology The technology in this area will be briefly discussed. We do not discuss other types of recording electrodes such as EMG electrodes and accompanying electrodes covered in other sources. In addition, we do not discuss deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology, which is widely used in patients with movement disorders (Kossof et al. 2004).<br>
However, it must be controlled because chronic implantation of excitation electrodes for DBS is a clinical association for the development of long-term brain electrode technologies and a testing ground for the development of BCI-compatible brain devices (see [Chapter 3](#chapter-3)).<br>
Electrodes are enabling technologies that encrypt information from the brain by computer algorithms to provide access to and control of BCI devices. Without these devices, we would not be able to transmit information from the brain that could be used to control BCI instruments. Likewise, it is often assumed that the technologies around BCI sensors are fully operational and there is little room for improvement. In fact, there is tremendous potential for the growth of these devices, and new types of invasive and non-invasive electrode technologies are needed to further the BCI applications. The main challenges are discussed at the end of this chapter.<br>
The purpose of this chapter is to review the current sensor technologies used for BCI offensive and non-invasive approaches across North America, Europe and Asia. We have visited and / or interacted with key laboratories specializing in these fields. Although not entirely comprehensive, this chapter provides an overview of the key sensor technologies developed for potential BCI applications.<br>
We look forward to working with Jason J. Bremister, a colleague at the University of Kentucky, to help us prepare this chapter.<br>

## Chapter 3
- ### Bio-non-biological interface
Brain-computer relationships (BCIs), or brain-system relationships (BMIs), are systems designed to help people with central nervous system disabilities, including inability to move, communicate, and control independently of the personal environment (Donoghue, 2002; Friehs et al, 2004; Lebedev and Nichols, 2006; Schwartz et al., 2006). Although these similar approaches can enhance normal functioning, this new class of biomedical devices is now thought to be designed to help people with disabilities. Thus, these devices may be useful for patients with a variety of conditions, including spinal cord injury, musculoskeletal disorders, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or other neuromuscular diseases. The purpose of these devices and the components associated with them is to provide or complement the motor or sensory function that has been lost. The theoretical basis for such devices is our ability to detect neural signals and translate voluntary commands into control signals for external devices such as computers, robotics, or other devices. The acquisition of neural signals has traditionally occurred in the cerebral cortex, and the recording of these signals from implanted electrodes has a relatively long history.<br>
Although several forms of technology are evolving, this chapter will focus exclusively on our current knowledge of the foreign body's response to aggressive technologies. In general, such devices are scarce by the standards of biomedical experiments and are implanted in the cerebral cortex, the most superficial aspect of the mammalian brain. As currently designed, they penetrate a few millimeters, depending on the target area and species. They contain several recording or excitation sites located in one or more penetrating shafts, which include conductive ceramics, metals or polymers, and have at least one insulating material. At present, such devices are connected to insulated wires that protrude from the skull and lead to external amplifiers and other devices, which are sizeable and not very reliable.<br>
Because of their design nature, recorders are often referred to as "penetrating electrode arrays."<br>
To date, CNS recorders have taught us a great deal about the functional organization and neurophysiological underpinnings of the mammalian cortex and other areas of the brain. It becomes quality. The lives of people with CNS-related disabilities (Lebedev and Nichols, 2006; Schwartz et al., 2006). The future economic impact of this technology seems equally remarkable. Along with other emerging technologies, we find ourselves on the verge of understanding one of the most complex and sophisticated systems the human brain has ever studied. What has been shown is that neural signals can be recorded by a number of different technologies in different species for periods of time from months to wells for more than a year. With direct reference to BCI or BMI technology, neural activity can be interpreted and used to control a computer or robot or prosthetic device.<br>
By exploring and proving the solid principle for various BCI and BMI programs, some focus has shifted to understanding how to maintain the continuous and long-term performance of implanted devices. Even if current plans typically perform as intended in short-term studies and plans, the major limitation of our current state of technology is the inconsistent performance of chronic or long-term plans that limits the clinical implementation of this promising technology (Polikov et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2006).<br>
Although it is believed that the response of brain tissue to implanted electrode arrays is a precise construct that ensures that the recording function is not inconsistent; Therefore, until the mechanisms underlying the loss of performance are understood, it seems unlikely that we will develop rational strategies to improve their usefulness.<br>
This chapter first discusses what is difficult to understand and lays the foundation for common terms. It then provides evidence that invasive electrodes can act over long periods of time to demonstrate the concept that this new class of biomedical device currently thought to be biocompatible. This current situation then examines the understanding of what happens after electrode implantation in mammalian brains and tries to identify gaps in our knowledge if possible in an attempt to clarify what still needs to be done. The conclusion is that by discussing the various strategies being developed to modify the biotic-abiotic interface in an effort to achieve better integration into brain tissue and achieve superior device function. We warn that most technologies focused on enhancing device performance, as promising as it may seem, are still under development and have not been replicated enough in most parts to understand our ultimate understanding of its ultimate impact.<br>
With all the signs, a full understanding of what needs to be done to continually interface different hardware with a variety of potential neural targets is still a long way off. It is now a major obstacle to understanding the science responsible for the loss of performance. Without understanding the increased and targeted budget for increasing the number of researchers working in this field, this understanding is unlikely to happen in the near future. The breadth and depth of science must advance, as has happened in cochlear implantation, so that this challenge shifts from a lack of scientific knowledge to engineering.<br>
