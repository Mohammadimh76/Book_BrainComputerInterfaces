Iam currently a Final-year BS.c student at the Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch (IAUN) (Rank in CWUR) where I am a member of the Bioinformatics Laboratory (BL), advised by Prof. Mohammad Naderi Dehkordi. my research involves machine vision, deep learning, and neural networks. where I will complete my thesis on Accurate and Early Identification of Diabetes and it's Affecting Factors.

Prior to BL, I finished my Diploma - Mathematics and Physics in Sheikh Ansari Highschool, in September 2015. I tried to use my Diploma to build a solid bedrock for my future research. So in addition to taking many optional bachelor-level courses on math and computer science. I spent 6 months as an intern Programmer at the "CoTech" in Isfahan.

#### My main research interests
- Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
- Optimization Algorithm, Neural & NeuroFuzzy Network
- Computer Vision, Signal and Image Processing
